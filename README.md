# MetricReduction
This document describes the process undertaken to identify the best metrics for use in genus IBI development. After metric reducing steps, as described in the document were performed, 77 metrics were identified for use in the coastal region and 94 metrics in the non-coastal region of Virginia. Further metric reduction may take place during the all-subset calculations and will be noted at the end of this document and in the all-subset Rmarkdown. The all-subset method will be used to develop the genus IBI candidate models for Virginia biologists to consider for different bioregions, seasons and stream sizes.

Metric reduction steps and all-subset methodologies employed in this document are found in the following literature:
